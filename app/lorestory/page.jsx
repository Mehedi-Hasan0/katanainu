            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              Some 7000 years ago, the land of Shen was a peaceful place of
              cultural wonder & balance. The progenitor race of Shukutai
              creatures prospered under the guidance of the Celestial Mother,
              whose knowledge was channeled to the Doge priests in the spiritual
              center city of Geto. The decentralized tenets of the Kodo religion
              were disseminated among the Shukutai peoples & all things were
              good and right.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              The Bulls & Bears existed in balance, their Ape cousins were
              measured and moral, the Floki Inu clan protected the borders of
              the kingdom & the Blockchain daughters of the Celestial Mother
              maintained the wondrous technologies bestowed upon the Shukutai.
              At the center of it all, the Katana Monk sect; a mysterious and
              esoteric order of warrior monks who guarded the most sacred sites
              & trained in the energetic arts.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              This period of time became known as the “The Great Culmination” &
              as with all peaceful times, abruptly ended with the emergence of
              the Cho Ginko demon & the beginning of the “The Great
              Subjugation”.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              The Shukutai endured immense hardship under the dominion of the
              Great Cho Ginko Demon, whose reign of oppressive control spread as
              far as the eye could see. After an initial destructive show of
              force directed at the city of Geto, the Shukutai become cut off
              from the Celestial Mother & her powerful energy. The peaceful and
              degenerate Shukutai peoples suffered for hundreds of years at the
              hands of this powerful Cho Ginko Demon, hoping, praying & looking
              up at the moon, dreaming of their freedom.

              When one lone Shukutai monk, nestled deep within the mountains of
              Tang, managed to perfect the Immortal Body technique and project
              his spirit beyond the bounds of earth, the threads of fate would
              be forever changed. This lone warrior monk, known only as the
              first venerable Katana Inu, would come in direct contact with the
              great spirit, the Celestial Mother Ledger & restore her connection
              to the land of Shen. Returning to earth with a powerful ally,
              Katana Inu fought alongside the Celestial Mother in “The ‘Great
              Decentralization”, a battle of cosmic proportions.

              Although she sustained mortal wounds in the process, the Celestial
              Mother vanquished the Cho Ginko demon & freed the Shukutai
              creatures from their oppression. As the great spirit took her last
              breath, a final gift was bestowed upon the Shukutai. The Celestial
              Mother fragmented her soul & sent its energies across the land of
              Shen, settling in objects now known as the sacred Kodo Relics.

            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              Myriad religions & mystical sects began to flourish in Shukutai
              society as the various factions slowly gathered the sacred relics,
              deciphering the curious symbols & codes engraved on their
              surfaces. Each faction of Shukutai seemed to interpret the relics
              in their own inquisitively unique ways, although they all
              understood the central message contained in each relic …
              decentralization.

            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              For 6000 years the Shukutai lived in peace following the Kodo
              religions decentralized tenets & harvesting energy from the moon
              using their sacred relics. The 7 main factions of Shukutai lived
              in balance, each playing their roles & maintaining strict
              decentralization at all levels of governance.

              1000 years before this very moment, the Ginko Clan arose from the
              shadows of Shen & like wild fire spread across the land. Stoking
              the flames of chaos among Shukutai society, the Ginko Clan acted
              swiftly & decisively in a campaign of subversion, manipulation &
              centralization. The 6th leader of the Ginko Clan, Noxin, abandoned
              the Kodo religion in 6203 BCE & began heavily petitioning Shukutai
              leaders to join in his ‘godless’ philosophy which encouraged a new
              value system. 100 years & 3 Ginko leaders would pass before
              Noxin’s wish would come true. In the year 6103 BCE that wish was
              granted, a state owned paper money system which would no longer
              required the verification of the Celestial Mothers ancient
              devices, was implemented.

            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              And so the Shukutai became tightly controlled in all aspects of
              life, the myths of the Celestial Mother Ledger & the First
              Venerable Katana Inu faded into obscurity. All relics of the
              Celestial Mother were slowly lost or stolen by the Ginko Clan
              Shadow Hunters who stopped at nothing to render each Shukutai
              faction powerless.
